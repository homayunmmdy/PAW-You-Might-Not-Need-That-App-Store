This repository contains my personal notes and code examples from the *PWAs: You Might Not Need That App Store* course on Frontend Masters, taught by Maximiliano Firtman.  

ðŸ“… **Course Timeline**  
- **Started:** July 28, 2025  
- **Completed:** August 1, 2025  

## ðŸš€ **About the Course**  
This course dives deep into **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**, teaching how to build installable, offline-capable web applications that deliver native-like experiences. Key topics covered include:  

- **PWA Fundamentals:** Core principles and advantages over traditional apps  
- **Installation & Discovery:** Making PWAs installable with manifest files, icons, and splash screens  
- **Offline Support:** Implementing service workers for reliable offline experiences  
- **Cross-Platform Optimization:** Tailoring PWAs for iOS, Android, and desktop  
- **App Store Submission:** Publishing PWAs to Apple App Store and Google Play  

Taught by **Maximiliano Firtman**, a renowned PWA expert, the course provides hands-on techniques to create high-performance web apps that rival native applications.  

## ðŸ”¥ **Why I Took This Course**  
Iâ€™ve worked with PWAs before but wanted to **sharpen my skills** and fill knowledge gaps. This course bundles everything from core concepts to advanced optimizations helping me:  
âœ” **Master service workers** for robust offline functionality  
âœ” **Optimize PWA installation** with platform-specific tweaks  
âœ” **Understand App Store submission** for wider distribution  
âœ” **Enhance performance** and user experience  

The structured learning helped me **solidify my PWA expertise**, making my apps faster, more reliable, and truly app-like.  

## ðŸ“¢ **Note on Course Access**  
Due to international sanctions in Iran, I was unable to access the official Frontend Masters platform directly. I obtained the course through a third-party distributor and completed it in full. Although I donâ€™t hold an official certificate, I carefully followed the course and documented my learnings here.

For hands on sections, youâ€™ll find working code samples. For theory-heavy parts, Iâ€™ve included detailed summaries and examples that reflect my understanding of the material.
