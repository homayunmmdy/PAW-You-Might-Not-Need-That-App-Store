Design Pattern to use different APIs and specs from the Web Platform
to create installable , offline-capable standalone apps for mobile and
desktop devices.

> Ideal for all those apps that consume web content or web services.

> It's not an API or a framework , just a term to describe a design Pattern

> Web Apps, installable Web Apps, Home screen Web Apps.
